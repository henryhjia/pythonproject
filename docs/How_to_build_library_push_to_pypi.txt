1. Create a Project Directory: Choose a name for your library and create a directory for it. 
$ mkdir mylibrary
$ cd mylibrary

2. Create a Python Package Structure: Inside your project directory, create a Python package structure. A basic structure includes a top-level directory with the same name as your library and an inner package directory. For example:

$ mkdir mylibrary
$ touch mylibrary/__init__.py

The __init__.py file is used to mark the directory as a Python package.

3. Add Modules: Create Python module files (.py) inside your package directory. These modules contain the code for your library. For example:

$ touch mylibrary/module1.py and add contents
$ touch mylibrary/module2.py and add contents
You can include functions, classes, and other code in these modules.

4. Create a README File: Create a README.md file to provide documentation for your library. You can use a text editor or the touch command to create the file:

$ touch README.md
Edit this file to include information about your library, how to use it, and any other relevant details.

5. Create a setup.py File: Create a setup.py file to define the metadata for your library. Here's a basic example:

from setuptools import setup

setup(
    name="mylibrary",
    version="1.0.0",
    description="Description of your library",
    author="Your Name",
    packages=["mylibrary"],
)

6. Install Required Tools: If you haven't already, you'll need to install the setuptools and wheel packages, which are used for packaging and distribution:

$ sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools python3-wheel

7. Package Your Library: Use the following command to create a source distribution of your library:

$ python3 setup.py sdist
This will generate a .tar.gz file in the dist/ directory.

8. Upload your library to PyPI:

$ sudo apt-get install twine
$ twine upload dist/*  # all tar.gz
$ twine upload dist/hjlibrary-2.0.tat.gz  # upload a perticular tar file


9. Install: In your library's directory, run the following command to install it locally:

$ pip install .

In your python code, add
from mylibrary.mymodule import my_class_name
